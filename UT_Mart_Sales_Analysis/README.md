# What is Tableau?

**Tableau** is one of the fastest-growing data visualization tools currently being used in the Business Intelligence industry.  
It provides a powerful way to transform raw data into an easily understandable format ï¿½ even for users with **zero technical or coding knowledge**.  
Tableau helps users create **pictorial and graphical representations** of data, making complex data insights accessible to everyone.

# UT Mart Sales Analytics

### Overview

**UT Discount Mart** is a small supermarket aiming to monitor its performance more effectively. A dashboard was created to help track key metrics such as  
**Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold** for the current year.

The dashboard also provides insights into the performance of different **product categories** and **regions**, enabling better strategic decisions.

It was important to confirm the assumption that most customers purchase **two or more items per order**, and the data was analyzed to validate this.  
Additionally, the business model assumes that **Profit is 30% of the selling price**, which has been factored into the dashboard calculations.

The final interactive dashboard allows users to **filter and explore shipping statistics by month and year**, offering a dynamic view of the business's performance and supporting **data-driven decision-making** for future growth.
